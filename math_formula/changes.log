v1.2.0
- Update positioning algorithm to work better with multiple outputs.
- Add support for the new vector math functions: 'Refract' and 'Faceforward'.
- Only check if it's a function if the next char is a '('. This allows attributes and functions
  with the same name.

v1.1.0
- Python constants can now be called without parentheses. This means that '!pi' is now valid.
  To indicate what is part of the python expression, parentheses should still be used. If you
  want the value pi/4, you should do '!(pi/4)' instead of '!pi/4', which would add a divide node.
- Calling functions with multiple values is now valid for binary functions (2 arguments). This 
  means that 'max(x,y,z)' is now valid. In addition to this, missing arguments are replaced with
  0 for math functions and with the string in the missing argument name property in the side panel
  for attribute math functions. 
- Font size can now be changed while editing the formula by using the scroll wheel.
- Syntax coloring now works for operators as well.
